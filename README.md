# Food Truck Project

## Description
This is my second project with Skill Distillery! The Food Truck Project takes user input to create and rate up to five food trucks, and from there choose from a menu of options and be presented with data created from their input.

The program begins by asking the user for the name of a food truck, what type of food the food truck serves, and what they would rate the food truck from 1 to 10. The user will continue to be prompted to enter new food trucks (and corresponding information about them) until they have entered five different trucks. If they wish to enter fewer than five, the simply need to type "quit" or "Quit" to end the food truck creation process. Once the creation process is over, a menu is printed out, displaying four options. The user can review all of the trucks which they have entered into the program, see the average rating of all food trucks, see the highest rated food truck, or exit the program.

## Lessons Learned
I definitely learned a lot to accomplish this project. I had to really understand and implement my knowledge on the difference between static and non static methods. It was a project requirement that the only static method was main. I created two separate classes, one to run the program itself, and another to create an array of food trucks. Once I realized that I had to create an array of objects that I created, my work became much more clear. I was initially stuck trying to squeeze all of my data into an array of strings. That was ugly for a little while. Understanding how the syntax works for non static methods had a little bit of a learning curve, but I do feel like I understand it much better, now. I had to go through my week's notes to really understand what it mean that a non-static method could only be called using an object, and static methods use a class. This strongly reinforced my knowledge of constructors, and I feel like if I were to redo this project, it would take significantly less time because of everything I learned.

I definitely struggled through this project, but came out the other side appreciating how much I learned. I feel good knowing that I was able to press onward after feeling lost for a  bit, and nail down my research methods when I am stuck.
